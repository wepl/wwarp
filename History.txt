***  1.29 (14.03.2020)
	- fix:	command Zap did not open trackdisk.device
	- new:	command Zap now also supports raw mfm data, first 16 bytes
		are considered as sync and used for verify
	- chg:	command Save on tracks of type RAW now honors a set sync, sync
		number and length and will shift and cut the mfm data to save
		accordingly
	- fix:	console handling improved, works also on vamos now
	source is accessible via: https://github.com/wepl/wwarp

***  1.28 (06.05.2008)
	- new:	supports 5.25" drives, 80 tracks, but not really tested (Mark)
	- chg:	tracklist will be compressed now, old WWarps cannot read these
		files if track 0 is not contained due a bug in old versions
	- chg:	builtin help improved a lot, more/less feature
	- chg:	new search routine for custom format detection which uses a
		lookup table, around 7 times faster as in version 1.27

***  1.27 (30.05.2007)
	- new:	option NoFmt/K added to exclude a list of formats from known
		formats detection
	- chg:	MFM2WWarp removed from distribution

***  1.26 (30.01.2006)
	- new:	format from the game SlackSkinAndFlint added (Codetapper)

***  1.25 (08.04.2005)
	- new:	support for trackwarp.library added, enables direct import of
		alien warp files
	- new:	option Force/S added to make WWarp to detect track formats
		with flag F during creating warp files using command C (e.g.
		while read from floppy or import), this obsolets aftwards
		usage of command F
	- chg:	packmodes do not work on specdata anymore, so packing is
		possible for tracks formats with special data

***  1.24 (16.11.2004)
	- new:	format rob northen copylock old, uses standard dos track
		with extra sync and data, decoder only, no write back
	- new:	MFM2WWarp supports also RNWarp and NOMADwarp

***  1.23 (28.10.2004)
	- fix:	limit support for hackdisk.device added, reading up to track
		161 works, 162/163 gives wrong results, writing crashes my
		machine, so I recommend to NOT use it (tested with 2.04)
	- fix:	could crash when not using asyncio and errors on file io

***  1.22 (04.10.2004)
	- new:	formats twilight2/3 added (Awesome/Psygnosis)

***  1.21 (06.07.2004)
	- fix:	write of non custom formats works again
	- fix:	SYBIL handling improved

***  1.20 (18.06.2004)
	- new:	MFM2WWarp supports CAPS/IPF images too (Psygore)
		MFM2WWarp uses asyncio.library if available

***  1.19 (28.04.2004)
	- fix:	degug code removed which caused illegal instruction exception
		on each custom format write back operation
	- note:	write back of RNCopyLock is still not working

***  1.18 (08.04.2004)
	- new:	command G to save contents of wwarp file as a dos disk image
	- new:	completed support for SYBIL hardware (calibration etc.)
	- new:	formats thalamus, goliath, beyond, hitec, mason (Codetapper)
	- new:	format Rob Northen Copylock, displays calculated ID's by
		several routines, write back only using SYBIL
	- chg:	MAXTRACKS increased to 168 which means upto cylinder 83 can
		be processed
	- chg:	simplified custom format interface
	- new:	support for MULTISYNC formats
	- new:	option DBG/K/N to set debug level, higher values causes wwarp
		to output debugging messages on several operations (see
		ReadMe.txt)
	- chg:	various minor changes and improvements

***  1.17 (02.12.2002)
	- new:	SpecialFX format added (Codetapper)
	- fix:	write back error introduced in 1.16

***  1.16 (02.12.2002)
	- chg:	again a bit faster scanning for custom formats
	- new:	custom formats Ocean, Twilight, Vision and ZZKJ added
		(Codetapper/Wepl)
	- new:	support for SYBIL hardware added, currently support is very
		limited, no speed adjustment, it will be improved later...
		many thanks to Galahad for the hardware :)
	- new:	command Z to write a data file as custom format to disk

***  1.15 (02.11.2002)
	- new:	program MFM2WWarp supports also old WWarp 1.3 file format
	- fix:	command Save did write wrong data on packed (LEQ/SLINC) tracks
		(Codetapper)
	- new:	pack mode SLEQ (sectors long equal)
	- new:	help screen lists also infos about all supported custom
		formats
	- chg:	faster scanning for custom formats

***  1.14 (28.08.2002)
	- chg:	program MFM2WWarp converts also files created by 'mfmwarp
		(Ferox), done by Psygore
	no changes on WWarp, only revision bumped

***  1.13 (09.05.2002)
	- new:	detected custom formats 'Turrican1/2/3', 'BloodMoney' and
		'Psygnosis1' added by Psygore
	- new:	program ADF2WWarp to convert UAE-MFM-ADF's to WWarp files
		by Psygore
	- fix:	command F(orce) clears the sync now

***  1.12 (15.12.2001)
	- new:	command I(nfo) prints all sync offsets
	- new:	detected custom formats 'PrimeMover', 'Beast1' and 'Beast2'
		added by Psygore

	- fix:	bug in post gap calculation on raw write fixed (could possible
		create wrong extra syncs)
	- new:	command P(ack) implemented
	- new:	DOS drive inhibit added on write operation

***  1.10 (28.10.2001)
	- fix:	verify does also work with raw tracks which contain multiple
		sync's, it prints a message and will try all syncs for verify
	- new:	on multiple syncs the number of the sync to use can be
		specified on command Y and will saved in the wwarp file too
		and will be used on all other commands afterwards
	- chg:	the routine to decode standard dos tracks has been recoded to
		be more tolerant for format errors and variations, should at
		least detect all which is read by AmigaDOS

***  1.9 (20.09.2001)
	- new:	uses asyncio.library if available to speed up file operations
		(modifying an existing wwarp file is around 100% faster)
	- fix:	indexsync on read works now, all raw tracks will be written
		after index pulse now
	- new:	support for high density disk+drive added
	- new:	support for cylinder 80/81 added
	- chg:	misc other minor changes

***  1.8 (24.07.2001)
	- new:	Rob Northen 12 sector format directly supported
	- chg:	before reading trackdisk buffers will be flushed/cleared

***  1.7 (31.03.2001)
	- chg:	command dump understands bit offsets now, e.g. use
		'wwarp test d 1 4489,2,-0.1' to see the track 1 shiftet to
		the first bit before the second sync 4489
	- new:	command save implemented
	- new:	writing of raw data implemented, sync must be set for this
	- new:	verify on writes added, it's default on and can disabled via
		option NoVerify/S

***  1.6 (06.08.2000)
	- new:	read retries are printed as a '.' after track number
	- fix:	display bug on missing tracks in file fixed
	- fix:	inter sector gap check on standard dos format detection
		improved a bit
	- chg:	command Force now skips all tracks which cannot be decoded
		instead of canceling the operation

***  1.5 (29.06.2000)
	- chg:	various changes ;-)
